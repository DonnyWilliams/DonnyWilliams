- 👋 Hi, I’m @DonnyWilliams
- 👀 I’m interested in working toward becoming a full stack developer. I know it's one step at a time. I'm still near the bottom of that staircase, but I'm climbing it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to code using Python, while expanding my familiarity with different frameworks and libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with people who are into learning and putting in the work to write really quality code. I'm also actively looking for an entry-level job! 
- 📫 How to reach me: williams dot donny at protonmail dot com
